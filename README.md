Proposal Summary

This XIP proposes to reward GP to early users who are depositors but didn't stake. The Infinex blog starts by naming many times that depositors will be rewarded with GPs, it does tells afterwards that staking will also be necessary, but this has lead to a number of early users to just depositing in this new app.

The idea is that to don't reward early depositors while airdropping to other external communities, isn't fair and defeats the purpose of giving GPs. Early depositors have contributed in a fair and desired way, by learning about Infinex and improving it's main metrics, like TLV, unique addresses and transactions.

To don't reward this early users will likely lead to lose them while they're the highest quality users/community members, they're the most likely to participate and the more unlikely to sell any future rewards since they're among the oldest. The Speedrun was made for this purpose in first place so we believe that this should be corrected.


Specification Overview

Infinex's early users who deposited in the first 7 days after Speedrun started, and withdrawn less than 7 days before Craterun ended, will be allocated with 50% of the GP that would belong to them if having staked. This GP will come from the allocation called "GP airdrops", or if this one is already allocated then from the ones allocated to non early Speedrun users like other communities. (Some feedback or ideas about from where would be appreciated)
